# Anomaly Image Detection Demo


Welcome to streamlit demo.
This demo implements three different anomaly detection methods
that are trained on healthy samples only: **SPADE**, **PaDiM** and **PatchCore**.

Use the sidepanel on the left to configure a training run.
After training you can browser through the predictions. 

You can also upload your own training set and test images!
